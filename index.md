# Leoo Bai (白德鑫)

👋 Hi, I'm Leoo Bai (白德鑫), founder of [https://Aiseo.icu/](https://aiseo.icu/), a startup focused on building the next generation of AI-powered SEO and multilingual digital marketing infrastructure.

👀 I'm passionate about AI-driven content generation, automated SEO, programmatic landing pages, and data-informed marketing strategies that help global brands scale organically.

💼 I'm also working for trade of tax, specializing in tax-related services and solutions for international business.

🌱 I'm currently working on advancing AI Optimization (AIO) — an evolution beyond traditional SEO — to help content become more discoverable by both users and AI summarization engines (e.g., SGE, GPT-based agents).

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with forward-thinking teams in AI content, MarTech SaaS, and cross-border e-commerce, especially those exploring multilingual AI, LLM-enhanced marketing, or programmatic content deployment.

📧 Reach me at [imleoo@gmail.com](mailto:imleoo@gmail.com) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/imleoo) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imleoo) @imleoo.
