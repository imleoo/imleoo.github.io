# Twitter's Viral Marketing Savior: Claude 4 Sonnet's Universal Prompt That Creates Full Marketing Campaigns in 90 Seconds

**Xiao Hai (tapping keyboard, frowning):** "Lao Bai, help! My AI scheduling tool just launched, and I'm going bald from stress about marketing—market research, SEO keywords, landing page copy, social media content... I can't handle all this alone! Outsourcing is expensive and slow. Is there any AI that can handle all this with one click?"

**Lao Bai (waving phone, eyes lighting up):** "Hey, what a coincidence! Yesterday I saw something incredible. A foreigner used a 'super prompt' with Claude 4 Sonnet that turned AI into a 'full-time marketing director.' Market research, SEO, ad copy, content strategy—it handles everything, delivering results in 90 seconds! Want to hear about it?"

**Xiao Hai (leaning in):** "Really? Is this just hype? Tell me what's going on!"

## Twitter's Viral "Marketing Savior": Claude 4 Sonnet's Universal Prompt

This all started with a certain SEO expert. He posted that a team fed Claude 4 Sonnet a "super prompt" that made it take over the entire marketing engine—from user research to landing pages, from SEO to email marketing, generating everything with properly formatted layouts.

(Lao Bai swipes open his phone, pulls up the message) "Look, the original post summarizes it in one sentence: 'Someone gave Claude 4 Sonnet a super prompt, and now it runs the entire marketing process: research → SEO → ad copy → content → strategy.' The comment section is filled with people begging for the prompt."

**Xiao Hai (rubbing hands anxiously):** "So what does this prompt actually look like? Is it some kind of black magic?"

**Lao Bai (pulling out memo app):** "Don't worry, I tracked it down! The core of this prompt is a three-part formula: 'role + input + instructions' that trains AI to become a 'full-stack marketing strategist.' Let me break it down for you—"

## 1. First, Give AI Its "Persona": Full-Stack AI Marketing Strategist

The first sentence of the prompt clearly states: "You are an AI marketing strategist for a startup company, responsible for market research, positioning, copywriting, content creation, email writing, and SEO planning."

This is like putting a "marketing director" hat on AI, letting it know what its KPIs are.

## 2. Input Your "Core Information": Product, Audience, Goals, Tone

Next, fill in four key pieces of information, and AI can "tailor-make" your solution:

**Product:** What exactly do you do? (For example, the user tested with "AI scheduling tool for 25-40 year old freelancers")

**Target Audience:** Who are your users? Age, occupation, pain points—write it all down! (For example, "independent entrepreneurs driven crazy by daily schedule management")

**Goals:** What do you want to achieve? User acquisition? Brand building? Sales? (For example, "gather 1000 potential customers before product launch")

**Tone:** Do you want users to see you as a professional expert or a down-to-earth friend? (For example, the user chose "sharp and driven")

## 3. Issue "Hardcore Instructions": I Want These Specific Results!

The most brilliant part is the instructions that follow—directly listing 6 major modules that AI must output:

**User Insights:** Generate "Ideal Customer Profile" (ICP), digging up their pain points and decision-making motivations;

**Conversion Copy:** Write compelling landing page copy (headlines, subheadlines, CTA), plus 3 viral headlines;

**Content Plan:** 7-day Twitter + LinkedIn posting schedule, including video ideas;

**Email Marketing:** 3 cold email templates (value-focused, pain-solving, case study);

**SEO Strategy:** 1 keyword topic cluster + 5 high-conversion blog titles + content structure;

**Output Format:** Must use Markdown, no nonsense, just give results!

**Xiao Hai (eyes growing wider):** "This is so detailed! But... can it really produce usable output?"

## Real Test: 90 Seconds from Zero to Complete Marketing Plan

**Lao Bai pats his chest:** "I had a friend test it with their AI scheduling tool! After inputting product information, AI immediately spat out:"

**User Persona:** 25-35 year old freelancers, taking 3-5 projects monthly, biggest headaches are "schedule changes disrupting plans" and "client demands taking up time";

**Landing Page:** Headline directly targets pain points—"Wasting 2 hours daily rescheduling? This AI tool lets you finish work on time";

**7-Day Content Plan:** Monday post "Where do freelancers' time go?" (builds resonance), Wednesday post "How I got 2 more clients using AI scheduling" (case study), Friday post "90% of people don't know these schedule management secrets" (valuable tips);

**SEO Titles:** "Must-read for freelancers: Top 3 AI scheduling tools for 2025", "Always delaying projects? AI schedule management improves client satisfaction by 80%"... all traffic-driving keywords!

(Lao Bai pulls up test result screenshots from his phone) "Look, this landing page copy, content schedule, SEO keywords—it's more practical than the 3000 yuan outsourcing I hired before! The key is—results in 90 seconds!"

**Xiao Hai (frantically taking notes):** "Where can I get this prompt? Can I use it directly?"

**Specific Input Requirements:** The four key inputs (product, audience, goals, tone) provide AI with enough context to generate tailored, relevant content.

**Structured Output Format:** The 6-module requirement forces AI to think systematically about all aspects of marketing, from research to execution.

## The Future of AI Marketing
